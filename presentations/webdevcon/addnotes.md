#Â good design
cost of making change is minimum

# observable
synchronous, async, lazy

# Different from promise
Promise can resolve to only one value

# Generator 
Genarator similar to observables, but generators pull

# Similar to event emitters
But Lazy, actual operation happens only on subscription

# angular 1
used promises extensively, especially for making HTTP requests
angular 2 - returns an observable
